# Weather Prediction Project üå¶Ô∏è

This repository contains a weather prediction project developed using Python. The project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze historical weather data and predict future weather patterns.

## Overview

The primary objective of this project is to build a predictive model that forecasts weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation. The model is trained on historical weather data and evaluated for its accuracy and reliability.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and analysis
- Data visualization to understand trends and patterns
- Machine learning model to predict weather conditions
- Interactive plots for deeper insights

## Tools and Libraries Used

The following Python libraries are utilized in this project:

- **[NumPy](https://numpy.org/)**: For numerical computations and handling arrays.
- **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)**: For static data visualization.
- **[Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)**: For enhanced and more aesthetic statistical visualizations.
- **[Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)**: For machine learning tasks including model building, training, and evaluation.
- **[Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)**: For creating interactive visualizations.
