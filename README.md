# Weather Prediction Project üå¶Ô∏è
This repository contains a weather prediction project developed using Python. The project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze historical weather data and predict future weather patterns.

Overview
The primary objective of this project is to build a predictive model that forecasts weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation. The model is trained on historical weather data and evaluated for its accuracy and reliability.

Features
Data preprocessing and analysis
Data visualization to understand trends and patterns
Machine learning model to predict weather conditions
Interactive plots for deeper insights
Tools and Libraries Used
The following Python libraries are utilized in this project:

NumPy: For numerical computations and handling arrays.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For static data visualization.
Seaborn: For enhanced and more aesthetic statistical visualizations.
Scikit-Learn: For machine learning tasks including model building, training, and evaluation.
Plotly: For creating interactive visualizations.
